    "\n",
    "Adjust the scaling: You can change the scaling of the graph to better accommodate the range of values for each figure. This can involve adjusting the axes limits, using logarithmic scaling, or applying different scaling techniques to enhance the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use different line styles or markers: You can differentiate the figures by using different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) or markers (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) for each figure. This helps visually distinguish between the lines or data points representing different figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vary the colors: Assigning distinct colors to each figure can enhance their visual separation. Choose colors that have high contrast to make the figures easily distinguishable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Adjust the position or layout: If the figures overlap or are too close to each other, you can adjust their positions or layout on the graph to create more space between them. This can involve repositioning the figures or using subplots to display them in separate regions of the graph.\n",

    "Compound interest refers to the process of earning interest not only on the initial principal amount but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. The benefit of compound interest lies in its ability to generate exponential growth of your investment over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the benefit of compound interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have two investment options:\n",
    "Option A offers an annual interest rate of 5% with compounding, while\n",
    "Option B offers an annual interest rate of 6% without compounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the higher interest rate of Option B might seem more attractive. However, when considering the long-term effects, compound interest can outperform a higher rate of interest without compounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, compound interest allows your investment to grow faster because the accumulated interest is reinvested and starts earning its own interest. This compounding effect leads to a snowballing growth of your investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you invest $10,000 in Option A with a 5% annual interest rate compounded annually for 10 years, the compounding effect will result in a higher overall return compared to Option B's higher rate of 6% without compounding. The difference in returns can be significant over longer investment horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound interest allows your money to work harder for you, leveraging the power of time and reinvestment of earnings. It provides the opportunity for exponential growth and can help you accumulate wealth more effectively over the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the benefit of compound interest becomes more pronounced with longer investment periods. Therefore, starting early and allowing your investments to compound over a longer duration can have a substantial impact on your financial goals."
